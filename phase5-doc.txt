Phase V: Advanced Cloud Deployment 

Advanced Level Functionality on DigitalOcean Kubernetes or Google Cloud (GKE) or 
Azure (AKS) 
Objective: Implement advanced features and deploy first on Minikube locally and then to 
production-grade Kubernetes on DigitalOcean/Google Cloud/Azure and Kafka on Redpanda 
Cloud. 

Part A: Advanced Features 
• Implement all Advanced Level features (Recurring Tasks, Due Dates & Reminders) 
• Implement Intermediate Level features (Priorities, Tags, Search, Filter, Sort) 
• Add event-driven architecture with Kafka 
• Implement Dapr for distributed application runtime 

Part B: Local Deployment 
• Deploy to Minikube 
• Deploy Dapr on Minikube use Full Dapr: Pub/Sub, State, Bindings (cron), Secrets, 
Service Invocation 

Part C: Cloud Deployment 
• Deploy to DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)/Google Cloud (GKE)/Azure (AKS) 
• Deploy Dapr on DOKS/GKE/AKS use Full Dapr: Pub/Sub, State, Bindings (cron), 
Secrets, Service Invocation 
• Use Kafka on Redpanda Cloud 
• Set up CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions 
• Configure monitoring and logging
