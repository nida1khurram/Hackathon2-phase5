# Cloud Kubernetes Deployment Skill

## Description
Deploys applications to cloud-based Kubernetes services including DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Capabilities
- Provision and configure managed Kubernetes clusters (DOKS, GKE, AKS)
- Set up cluster networking (VPC, subnets, load balancers)
- Configure cluster autoscaling (horizontal and vertical)
- Set up node pools with different machine types
- Configure cluster security (RBAC, network policies, pod security policies)
- Deploy applications using kubectl to cloud clusters
- Set up ingress controllers and SSL certificates
- Configure persistent volumes and storage classes
- Implement cluster monitoring and logging
- Set up cluster backup and disaster recovery
- Configure cluster authentication and authorization
- Manage cluster lifecycle (upgrades, maintenance windows)
- Set up multi-region deployments
- Configure cluster cost optimization
- Implement security scanning and compliance
- Set up cluster observability and alerting

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of Kubernetes concepts and architecture
- Knowledge of cloud infrastructure services (DigitalOcean, GCP, Azure)
- Experience with infrastructure as code (Terraform, ARM templates)
- Familiarity with security best practices for cloud deployments
- Understanding of networking concepts in cloud environments

## Usage Examples
- Production deployments of microservices applications
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud deployments
- High availability applications with regional redundancy
- Scalable applications with auto-scaling capabilities
- Enterprise applications with strict security requirements
- Cost-optimized deployments with resource management
