# Dapr Implementation Skill

## Description
Implements Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) for building portable, event-driven, resilient microservices with support for pub/sub, state management, service invocation, bindings, and secrets management.

## Capabilities
- Set up Dapr runtime in development and production environments
- Implement pub/sub messaging patterns using Dapr
- Manage application state using Dapr state stores
- Enable service-to-service invocation with Dapr
- Configure input and output bindings (cron, HTTP, queue triggers)
- Manage secrets securely using Dapr secret stores
- Implement actors pattern with Dapr
- Configure middleware for routing and security
- Integrate with various state stores (Redis, CosmosDB, etc.)
- Integrate with message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Monitor Dapr sidecars and applications
- Configure Dapr components for different environments
- Implement circuit breaker and retry policies
- Handle distributed tracing with Dapr
- Deploy Dapr to Kubernetes clusters
- Secure Dapr communications with mTLS

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of microservices architecture
- Knowledge of containerization and orchestration
- Familiarity with Kubernetes (for K8s deployments)
- Basic understanding of service mesh concepts

## Usage Examples
- Building event-driven microservices
- Implementing stateful services with reliable storage
- Creating resilient service-to-service communication
- Integrating with external systems via bindings
- Managing configuration and secrets securely
- Implementing actor-based patterns for concurrent processing
- Building polyglot microservices ecosystems
