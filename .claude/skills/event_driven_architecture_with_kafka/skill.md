# Event Driven Architecture with Kafka Skill

## Description
Implements event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka for building scalable, resilient systems that can handle real-time data streams and asynchronous communication between services.

## Capabilities
- Design and implement event-driven microservices architecture
- Set up Kafka topics for different types of events
- Create producers to publish events to Kafka
- Create consumers to subscribe to and process events
- Handle event serialization/deserialization (JSON, Avro)
- Implement event partitioning strategies
- Manage consumer groups and offsets
- Handle event ordering and delivery guarantees
- Implement event sourcing patterns
- Set up event replay mechanisms
- Monitor event flow and throughput
- Handle event schema evolution
- Implement dead letter queues for failed events
- Design event contracts and schemas

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of microservices architecture
- Knowledge of asynchronous messaging concepts
- Familiarity with Kafka ecosystem (Zookeeper, Schema Registry, etc.)

## Usage Examples
- Processing user activity streams in real-time
- Building audit trails and change logs
- Implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Handling payment processing workflows
- Managing inventory updates in e-commerce systems
- Real-time analytics and monitoring
- Order processing pipelines
- Notification systems
